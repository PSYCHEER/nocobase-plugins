# @psycheer/plugin-license-removal

Remove irrelevant things from menus like plugins which cannot be disabled in docker community edition.

# WORK IN PROGRESS (while API returns unauthorized even in log in screen, after this fixation plugin does not appear in working state, does not hide anything)

## Where it doesn't work
- When user is not logged in (login, register, auth pages)
- On root page ("/" or "/index.html")
